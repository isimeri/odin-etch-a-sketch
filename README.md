# The Odin Project: Etch-a-sketch -- [[live]](https://isimeri.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/)

A basic drawing app for desktop.

The app has:
- color picking
- eyedropper tool
- grid toggle
- resize functionality
- rainbow mode

Implemented using a bunch of divs to make up the board, so it has to be humble so as to be performant.
